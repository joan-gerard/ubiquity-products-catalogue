# Ubiquity Front-End Test Assignment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

Clone this repositery and install the dependencies:

### `npm install`

Once the dependencies are installed, run the server:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Left to complete

- Filter popup window should close when clicking outside of it.
- Utility Bar component to disappear when in Product Page Detail
- Auto complete search
- Default/active effect on List and Grid icons
- Ideally the position of the filter popup would match the Figma design (as of now, the popup is not aligned with the utility bar)
- Write unit tests
